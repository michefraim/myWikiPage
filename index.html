            <p>Hapoel Jerusalem Club was established in 1926 and played in the inaugural season of the EIFA league,
                playing the league's first match against local rivals Maccabi Hasmonean Jerusalem.<br /> The club
                played in the league for its first three seasons, however, the club was restricted to playing mainly
                in the Jerusalem area due to travelling difficulties. The club participated occasionally in the
                Palestine Cup, reaching the cup final in 1943, losing to a team from the Royal Artillery.
                <br /><br />

                After the establishment of Israel, the club registered to play in the makeshift second tier league,
                Liga Meuhedet, in the Jerusalem-Central division, which the club won. The club continued to play in
                the second division (Liga Bet until 1956 and Liga Alef afterwards), until it was promoted to the top
                division at the end of the 1956–57 season, after finishing second in promotion play-offs. Following
                the promotion, the club stayed in the top division for 21 seasons, achieving its best position, 3rd,
                in 1972–73. In 1971–72 the club reached the State Cup final, losing to Hapoel Tel Aviv 0–1. A season
                later, the club reached the cup final again, this time winning the cup. <br /><br />

                The club played in the third tier Liga Aleph after being relegated from the second tier Liga Leumit
                in the 2016–17. On 26 August 2019 the Israeli Football Federation refused to list the club for
                2019–20 season due to financial problems. <br /><br />

                On August 9, 2020 the club has been officially recreated, as Hapoel Katamon renamed to
                <strong>Hapoel Jerusalem.</strong>
